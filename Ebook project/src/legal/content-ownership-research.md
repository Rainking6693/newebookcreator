## Current Legal Landscape

### AI-Generated Content Ownership

#### United States
- **Copyright Office Position (2023)**: Works "produced by a machine or mere mechanical process" without creative input from a human author cannot be registered for copyright
- **Human Authorship Requirement**: Copyright requires human creativity and authorship

### Platform Liability Considerations

#### Safe Harbor Protections
